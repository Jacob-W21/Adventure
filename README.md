# Adventure
This was a multi scene game I programmed when I first started learning Java, using Slick2D.
The game itself is nothing special, you just get to walk betwwen the 3 maps I created using tile maps and a tile map editor. The gaame has the option to save and quit which saves your characters information to a data file so you can reload in as the gender of choice of which map you were on when you left.

This is a GIF demonstrating the function of the program. Had I worked on it more I had plans to add inventory and random items you could pick up depending on the map, as well as giving function to the chests, and giving the character health/weapons/etc, and eventually add enemies. However, this was mainly just a learning opportunity to look at what its like to be game developer.
